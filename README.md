# Dockerfiles

----
## Purpose
This repository contains dockerfiles base images. They are intended to be layered under application
docker imags.

## Build Instructions
Build as normal (example):

    # docker build base-ruby/2.6.3 -t base-ruby:2.6.3

## Note
These are updated only as often as I need them. While you're welcome to use these as-is, it's
probably better if you fork and update your own.
